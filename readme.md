# Plex Plugin for SmoothStreamsTV

## About

Forked from https://bitbucket.org/stankness/sstv-plex-plugin/overview on 25 MAR 2017

This is a Plex plugin to access your SmoothStreamsTV account.

## Installation

- Unzip the downloaded file and place the smoothstreams2.bundle folder in the correct location for your Plex Media Server platform â€“ see here for details: https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201106098-How-do-Ifind-the-Plug-Ins-folder-
- Using a web browser open Plex Web (http://PLEXSEVERIP:32400/web/index.html) and select Channels
- Smoothstreams should be in the Channels list now. Hover over the Smoothstreams channel and click on the cog to configure.
- You should then be able to open the Smoothstreams channel and start watching the streams

## Options
Set your username, password and service according to your provider.

### My Search
This is an area where you can setup custom entries for the plugin's home page. This will do a search based on the terms. You can use any strings to match the title, description or category in the guide. Items are separated by a semicolon (;) so that you can make multiple entries.

You can also use the following keywords:

- NOW: Only return content that is currently on
- NEXT: Only return content that is starting in the next 90 minutes (can't be used at the same time as NOW)
- BEST: Return only one item for each event so you get the best quality of each show, should only be needed it Stream Quality Preference is set to 'Both'.

#### Example
```
LiveNHL:NHL NOW;NFL;Movies NEXT;NOW BEST;US Sports:NFL NHL NBA Baseball;Devils:"New Jersey Devils"
```

Would make six entries.

- All shows in the NHL category and any other shows with the term 'NHL' in the title or description. This will get a custom title of 'LiveNHL'
- All shows in the NFL category and shows with the term 'NFL' in the title or description
- All shows in the Movies category that start in the next 90 minutes
- All shows that are currently on with the best quality of each show available
- All shows matching the words: NFL NHL NBA and Baseball with a custom title of 'US Sports'
- All shows matching the exact string "New Jersey Devils". This will get a custom title of 'Devils'

### Stream Quality Preference
Filter shows by SD, HD or allow both. Note: The channels of the 'blocked' streams are still usable but they are just obscured in the EPG.

### HLS or RTMP
Selection of video stream type. HLS is smoother but has a 15 sec delay compared to RTMP.

### Sports Only?
- On: Use the default, official guide which only shows live sporting events.
- Off: Use the extended guide (thanks fog) which shows content for all channels. This will make the plugin slower because of the larger guide information.
